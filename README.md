## Api communication

That's the weirdest, please make sure you have chrome installed first.

1. Start the app
2. Start chrome
3. Start remote debugging in chrome [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/)
4. In devtools, goto `network` tab
5. In the app, goto login
6. Set data, and login. This should trigger a network request (visible in chrome devtools)
